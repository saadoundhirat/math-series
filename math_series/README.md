# **math-series**

## Problem Domain

** in this lab we are solving the problem domain for some of recursion examples such as fibonacci and lucas

- writing aTDD functions for fibonacci and lucas and return the nth value.
- handing some of the side effect cases that might happen in the running time in the functions.
- building afunction for other cases
  compute the nth value of a summation series.
    :param n0=0: value of zeroth element in the series
    :param n1=1: value of first element in the series

    This function should generalize the fibonacci() and the lucas(),
    so that this function works for any first two numbers for a sum series.
    Once generalized that way, sum_series(n, 0, 1) should be equivalent to fibonacci(n).
    And sum_series(n, 2, 1) should be equivalent to lucas(n).

    sum_series(n, 3, 2) should generate antoehr series with no specific name

    The defaults are set to 0, 1, so if you don't pass in any values, you'll
    get the fibonacci sercies

Lab estmited time:
** Estimate of time needed to complete: _4hours

** Start time: 4pm

** Finish time: 12pm

** Actual time needed to complete: 8hours
   note: the lab is not finished yet iam trying to under stand the function cases
